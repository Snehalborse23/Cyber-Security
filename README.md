# Cyber-Security Project Implement Caesar Cipher
### 🎯 Objective  
Create a Python program that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.  
Users can enter a message and a shift value (1–25) to perform encryption and decryption.

---

### 🧩 Description  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques.  
Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
- **Encryption:** shifts letters forward.  
- **Decryption:** shifts letters backward by the same shift value.  
Plaintext : HELLO
Encrypted : KHOOR
Decrypted : HELLO

### This project is part of Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship Tasks, focusing on basic cryptography concepts.
